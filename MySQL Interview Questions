1. What is MySQL?
MySQL is one of the most popular open-source DBMS (database management system). MySQL is easy to use, reliable, and fast. 
A DB management system that works on embedded systems as well as client-server systems. 

2. Why is MySQL so popular? 
First of all, MySQL is open-source. Second, it is widely adopted, so a lot of code is already available. 
Even entire developed systems are there that can be referred to for the upcoming projects.
MySQL has relational databases; hence it makes it have methodical storage rather than a big dump of unorganized mess. 
And finally, as said earlier, MySQL is quick and robust. 

3. What are the tables in MySQL? Explain the types.
MySQL stores everything in logical tables. Tables can be thought of as the core storage structure of MySQL. 
And hence tables are also known as storage engines. Here are the storage engines provided by MySQL:

· MyISAM – MyISAM is the default storage engine for MySQL. It extends the former ISAM storage engine.
  MyISAM offers big storage, up to 256TB! The tables can also be compressed to get extra storage. MyISAM tables are not transaction-safe. 

· MERGE – A MERGE table is a virtual table that consolidates different MyISAM tables that have a comparable structure to one table. 
  MERGE tables use the indexes of the base tables, as they do not have indexes of their own.

· ARCHIVE – As the name suggests, Archive helps in archiving the tables by compressing them, in-turn reducing the storage space.
  Hence, you can store a lot of records with the Archive. It uses the compression-decompression procedure while writing and reading the table records. 
  It is done using the Zlib library.

· CSV – This is more like a storage format. CSV engine stores the values in the Comma-separated values (CSV) format.
  This engine makes it easier to migrate the tables into a non-SQL pipeline.

· InnoDB – InnoDB is the most optimal while choosing an engine to drive performance. 
  InnoDB is a transaction-safe engine. Hence it is ACID-compliant and can efficiently restore your database to the most stable state in case of a crash.

· Memory– Memory tables were formerly known as HEAP. With memory tables, there can be a performance boost as the tables are stored in the memory. 
  But it does not work with large data tables due to the same reason.

· Federated – Federated tables allow accessing remote MySQL server tables. It can be done without any third-party integration or cluster technology.

4. Write a query for a column addition in MySQL
For this, an ALTER TABLE query is required. Once invoked, simply mention the column and its definition. Something like this:

ALTER TABLE cars
ADD COLUMN engine VARCHAR(80) AFTER colour;

5. What is a foreign key? Write a query to implement the same in MySQL.
A foreign key is used to connect two tables. A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or assortment of it) in one table that alludes to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. 
To assign a foreign key, it is important to mention it while creating the table. It can be assigned by invoking the FOREIGN KEY query. Something like this:

FOREIGN KEY (Any_ID) REFERENCES Table_to_reference(Any_ID)

6. What is MySQL workbench?
MySQL Workbench is a bound together visual instrument for database modelers, designers, and DBAs. 
MySQL Workbench provides Data modelling, SQL, and server setup set of administrative tools. 
To put it simply, MySQL workbench makes it possible to operate the database management system through GUI. 

7. How does database import/export work in MySQL?

It can be done in two ways. One is to use phpMyAdmin, and the second is to use the command line access of MySQL. 
The latter can be done by using the command named mysqldump. It goes something like this:

· mysqldump -u username -p databasename > dbsample.sql

To import a database into MySQL, only a sign change is required, with a command of MySQL. The command goes something like this:

· mysql -u username -p databasename < dbsample.sql

#8. How can we delete a column or a row in MySQL?
Now dropping a column can be simply done by using the ALTER TABLE command and then using the DROP command. It goes something like this:

ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column name;

To drop a row, first, an identification for the row is required. Once that is handy, use the DELETE command in conjunction with the conditional WHERE command. 
Something like this:

DELETE FROM cars WHERE carID = 3;

9. What are the different ways to join tables in MySQL?

Join is used to link one or more tables together, with the common column’s values in both tables. Primarily there are four types of joins:

1. Inner Join – Inner join uses a join predicate, which is a condition used to make the join. Here is the syntax:

SELECT something FROM tablename INNER JOIN another table ON condition;

2. Left Join – Left join also requires a join condition. The left join chooses information beginning from the left table. 
For each entry in the left table, the left compares each entry in the right table. Here is the syntax:

SELECT something FROM tablename LEFT JOIN another table ON condition;

3. Right Join – Opposite to left join and, with one difference in the query, that is the name of join. Here care should be taken about the order of tables. 
Here is the syntax:

SELECT something FROM tablename LEFT JOIN another table ON condition;

4. Cross Join – Cross join has no join condition. It makes a cartesian of rows of both the tables. Here is the syntax:

SELECT something FROM tablename CROSS JOIN another table;
